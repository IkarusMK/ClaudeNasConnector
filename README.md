# ClaudeNasConnector

> Give Claude a Hermes-style agent home — on your own NAS.

Self-hosted [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that turns your NAS into a **personal Claude connector**. Like agent frameworks such as [Hermes](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com), it gives your assistant a persistent identity and real reach — but it runs in **your** network and plugs straight into the Claude apps you already use.

Add it once as a *custom connector* and Claude gains:

- 🧠 **Consistent memory** that lives on your NAS and follows you across every device
- 📱 **Work from anywhere** — the *same* brain on desktop **and** mobile, one account, one state
- 🗂️ **A skill router** — your skills live on your NAS; Claude *searches* them and loads the right one on demand (progressive disclosure)
- 🛠️ **Your tools** — home automation, document stores, a 3D printer, finance APIs … as callable MCP tools
- 🤝 **Multi-agent ready** — shared memory + registry so several agents can share one brain

The model stays in Anthropic's cloud. **Your data, skills, and secrets stay on your NAS.** Claude talks to this server over an HTTPS connector; the server uses your local credentials internally and never hands them to the model.

> ⚠️ **Status: early.** It currently ships a working `ping` tool that proves the full chain (NAS → reverse proxy → Claude connector). Memory tools and the skill router are on the roadmap below; **OAuth authentication is already supported** (see [Authentication](#authentication)). **Do not expose this publicly without enabling it.**

## How it works

```
Claude app (desktop / mobile)  ·  one or many agents
        │  custom connector (HTTPS, from Anthropic's cloud)
        ▼
Reverse proxy (Zoraxy / Caddy / nginx / Traefik …)
        │
        ▼
ClaudeNasConnector  (this container, on your NAS)
        │  uses local files & secrets
        ▼
Memory  ·  Skills (searchable)  ·  Your tools & APIs
```

```

> **No `deps/` folder?** Correct — dependencies are baked **into the image** at build time, so there's no install-on-start volume. The `data/`, `logs/` and `secrets/` folders keep their structure via `.gitkeep`; their *contents* are git-ignored so nothing private is committed.

## Memory, skills & the skill router

This is the heart of the project — making Claude *itself* portable, not just chat.

- **Memory** lives as plain files under `data/memory`. Tools (`memory_read` / `memory_write` / `memory_list`) let Claude recall and update what it knows about you — the same on every device.
- **Skills** live as folders under `data/skills` (`<skill>/SKILL.md` + resources). The router tools — `skill_search` / `skill_load` / `skill_resource` — let Claude find the right skill for a request and pull in **only what it needs** (progressive disclosure, the same idea as tool search).
- **Wire it up once.** Add a short instruction to your Claude **Project** so the assistant always consults the router first — see [`docs/claude-project-instructions.md`](docs/claude-project-instructions.md). After that, "find the right skill / tool and apply it" just happens, from any device.

Tools follow the same pattern: add an integration once on the NAS, and it's discoverable and callable everywhere.

## Multi-agent ready

The design lets several agents share one NAS brain without stepping on each other:

- **Namespaced memory** — memory is addressed by scope, so agents share common knowledge while keeping private notes (`shared` vs. per-agent).
- **Shared skill & tool registry** — every agent queries the same `skill_search` and tool set; add a capability once, all agents get it.
- **Per-agent workspaces** — isolated working directories under `data/work` for parallel tasks.
- **(Planned) agent inbox** — an append-only channel for agent-to-agent and agent-to-you messages, à la Hermes.

Full orchestration (spawning/coordinating sub-agents) is on the roadmap; the seams above are in place so it can land **without a rewrite**. See [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Requirements

- A NAS or server running **Docker** (Compose v2).
- A **reverse proxy** that serves the container over public HTTPS — Claude connects from Anthropic's cloud, so the endpoint must be reachable from the internet.
- A domain/subdomain pointing at your proxy.
- A **Claude plan** that supports custom connectors (Free is limited to one; Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise support more).

## Quick start

```bash
git clone git@github.com:IkarusMK/ClaudeNasConnector.git
cd ClaudeNasConnector
cp .env.example .env        # adjust PUID / PGID / HOST_PORT / TZ
docker compose up -d --build
```

The MCP endpoint is served at `http://<host>:8787/mcp`.

### Expose it & add the connector

1. Point a subdomain (e.g. `agent.example.com`) at your reverse proxy.
2. Proxy that host to `http://<nas-ip>:8787` over HTTPS.
   - The upstream is **plain HTTP** — do *not* enable "TLS to upstream".
   - If your proxy uses geo-blocking, **allow Anthropic's region (US)** for this host, or the connector cannot reach you.
3. In the Claude app: **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector** → URL `https://agent.example.com/mcp`.
4. Test: ask Claude to call the `ping` tool.

## Configuration

All config lives in `.env` (copy from `.env.example`):

| Variable    | Default | Description |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| `HOST_PORT` | `8787`  | Host port the server is published on (the container always listens on `8787` internally) |
| `PUID`      | `1000`  | User ID the process runs as (file ownership) |
| `PGID`      | `1000`  | Group ID the process runs as |
| `TZ`        | `UTC`   | Container timezone |

## Authentication

Protect the connector with OAuth before you expose it. It uses **your own OIDC
identity provider** as the login backend — Pocket ID, Authentik, Keycloak, Auth0,
anything with standard OIDC discovery. FastMCP's OIDC proxy handles the MCP-side
OAuth 2.1 flow (Dynamic Client Registration + PKCE) that the Claude connector
speaks; your provider just does the actual login.

> ℹ️ **Don't** put browser/forward-auth (reverse-proxy SSO) in front of the
> `/mcp` endpoint — the Claude connector is a *machine* client and can't follow an
> interactive login redirect. Authentication must happen at the MCP layer, which
> is exactly what this does.

Enable it by setting these in `.env` (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Example |
|----------|---------|
| `OIDC_CONFIG_URL` | `https://id.example.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| `OIDC_CLIENT_ID` / `OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET` | from a client you register in your provider |
| `BASE_URL` | `https://agent.example.com` (this server's public URL) |
| `JWT_SIGNING_KEY` | `openssl rand -hex 32` |

Register the OAuth client in your provider with redirect URI
**`<BASE_URL>/auth/callback`**. Then (re-)add the custom connector in Claude — it
will send you through your provider's login. When the OIDC variables are unset the
server runs open (local testing only).

## Security

- This server is reachable from the public internet via your proxy. **Enable [Authentication](#authentication) before exposing it** — anyone who reaches the endpoint can otherwise call its tools.
- Keep all real credentials (API tokens, etc.) in `.env` / a secrets store **on your NAS**. They are used server-side and never sent to the model.
- `.env` and `data/` contents are git-ignored — never commit secrets.

## Roadmap

- [x] Walking skeleton: `ping` tool + remote MCP over HTTPS
- [x] Authentication: OAuth 2.1 via your own OIDC provider (Pocket ID, Authentik, Keycloak, Auth0, …)
- [ ] Memory tools (`memory_read` / `memory_write` / `memory_list`), namespaced for multi-agent
- [ ] Skill router (`skill_search` / `skill_load` / `skill_resource`)
- [ ] Built-in tool integrations (Home Assistant, etc.)
- [ ] Multi-agent: agent inbox + sub-agent orchestration
- [ ] Prebuilt image on GHCR
