"""Network egress guard — SSRF boundary for the model-driven dispatchers.

service_add / mqtt_add / ftp_add are themselves tools, so a prompt-injected
model could register an INTERNAL target (cloud metadata at 169.254.169.254, a
LAN admin panel, localhost services) and then call it. The list of registered
services is therefore NOT an SSRF boundary on its own.

This module is the boundary: every outbound host is resolved and each resolved
IP is checked. Private, loopback, link-local, reserved, multicast and
unspecified addresses are BLOCKED — unless the IP falls inside an
operator-configured allow-list (``INTERNAL_ALLOW_CIDRS``, env-only, NOT settable
by the model). Public addresses are allowed.

Set ``INTERNAL_ALLOW_CIDRS`` to the internal ranges you actually use, e.g. your
LAN and/or a VPN subnet:

    INTERNAL_ALLOW_CIDRS=192.168.178.0/24,100.64.0.0/10
